**Challenges**
We started the infamous "Salmon Cookies" project in lab. At first I felt pretty good about today's assignment, but I ended up stuck on calculating the total cookies for each store. After speaking with both Michael and Michelle, I realized that I needed to restructure my entire project.

**Overcoming Challenges**
I started working almost immediately once I got home and worked for several hours until I saw the cookies total, but I made it happen. There were many points during which I thought I could easily leave it as is for tomorrow, but I'm happy I stuck it out.
