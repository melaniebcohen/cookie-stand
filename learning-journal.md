#### Day 6 | Monday, December 11
Covered the following in class:
- Intro to Markdown
- Intro to JS Objects
- Intro to the D.O.M.

**Challenges**
We started the infamous "Salmon Cookies" project in lab. At first I felt pretty good about today's assignment, but I ended up stuck on calculating the total cookies for each store. After speaking with both Michael and Michelle, I realized that I needed to restructure my entire project.

**Overcoming Challenges**
I started working almost immediately once I got home and worked for several hours until I saw the cookies total, but I made it happen. There were many points during which I thought I could easily leave it as is for tomorrow, but I'm happy I stuck it out.

#### Day 7 | Tuesday, December 12
Covered the following in class:
- Constructor Functions
- HTML Tables

**Challenges**
Continuing the Salmon Cookies project by moving the values from list items to a table. The assignment actually made a lot more sense to me after learning about constructor functions. My biggest challenges were calculating totals (I was only able to calculate the 6 AM total) and the main page's formatting (positioning is a challenge to say the least).

**Overcoming Challenges**
I worked as long as I could on the totals, but I think I will try to speak with a TA tomorrow rather than continue to spin my wheels on it. At a certain point, it becomes counter-productive.
